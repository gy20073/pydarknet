## Pre-requisites
1) Python 3.5
2) Numpy `pip3 install numpy`
3) Cython `pip3 install cython`
4) Optionally, OpenCV 3.x with Python bindings. (Tested on OpenCV 3.4.0)
    - You can use [this script](tools/install_opencv34.sh) to automate Open CV 3.4 installation (Tested on Ubuntu 16.04).
    - Performance of this approach is better than not using OpenCV.
    - Installations from PyPI distributions does not use OpenCV.
```
NOTE: OpenCV 3.4.1 has a bug which causes Darknet to fail. Therefore this wrapper would not work with OpenCV 3.4.1.
More details are available at https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/issues/502
```

## Installation
Installation from PyPI distribution (as described below) is the most convenient approach if you intend to use yolo34py for your projects.

### Installation of CPU Only Version
```bash
pip3 install yolo34py
```

### Installation of GPU Accelerated Version
```bash
pip3 install yolo34py-gpu
```

```
NOTE: PyPI Deployments does not use OpenCV due to complexity involved in installation. 
To get best performance, it is recommended to install from source with OpenCV enabled.
```

## How to demos in local machine?
1) If you have not installed already, run `python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace` to install library locally.
2) Download "yolov3" model file and config files using `sh download_models.sh`.
3) Run `python3 webcam_demo.py`, `python3 video_demo.py` or `python3 image_demo.py`

## How to run demo using docker?
1) Navigate to [docker](/docker) directory.
2) Copy sample images into the `input` directory. Or else run [input/download_sample_images.sh](docker/input/download_sample_images.sh)
3) Run `sh run.sh`
4) Observe the outputs generated in `output` directory.

## Installation from Source
1) Set environment variables
 - To enable GPU acceleration, `export GPU=1`.
 - To enable OpenCV, `export OPENCV=1`
 
2) Navigate to source root and run `pip3 install .` to install library.

### Using a custom version of Darknet
1) Set environment variable DARKNET_HOME to download location of darknet.
2) Add DARKNET_HOME to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$DARKNET_HOME`
3) Continue instructions for _installation from source_.
